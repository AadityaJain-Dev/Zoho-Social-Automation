You can use these scripts for remotely publishing stuff on your social media profile & pages.

With a free zoho social account you can connect a **Facebook Page**, a **Facebook Group**, a **Twitter Profile**, a **Linkedin Profile**, a **Linkedin Company Page**, **Google My Business** & a **Instagram Profile** and publish stuff on all of them with a simple click.

## Usage

1. Open "puppeteer-script.js" replace "YOUR-ZOHO-USERNAME" with your zoho username & "YOUR-ZOHO-PASSWORD" with your password.
2. open Terminal & execute "node index.js"

Note: With puppeteer we can also handle File uploads, this function as of now is not available in PhantomJsCloud, the support team said they are working on it & hopefully add it in few months.
